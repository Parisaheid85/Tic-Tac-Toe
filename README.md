Tic-Tac-Toe

This game is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

Is made with DOM in Vanilla JS which stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. 

This was my first project with JS, HTML and CSS and have a little bug with the DRAW on the BOARD.
